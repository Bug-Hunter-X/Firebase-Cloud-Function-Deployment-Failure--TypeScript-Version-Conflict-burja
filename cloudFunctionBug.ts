In a Firebase project, when using Cloud Functions, an uncommon error arises when deploying functions written in TypeScript that depend on other npm packages. The error message is often vague, sometimes indicating a problem with the deployment process itself or a missing dependency.  However, the root cause may be an incompatibility between the TypeScript version used in the function's `tsconfig.json` and the version expected or supported by Firebase's deployment tools.  The deployment may fail silently or produce a confusing error about module resolution or package installation. For example, a function might compile locally without issues but fail during Firebase deployment.
