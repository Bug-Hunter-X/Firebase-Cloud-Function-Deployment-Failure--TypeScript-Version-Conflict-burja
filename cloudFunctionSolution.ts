```typescript
// cloudFunctionSolution.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';

export const helloWorld = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Firebase!');
});
```

**Key Changes:**

*   The solution often involves specifying a specific TypeScript version (or a range) in the `package.json` file and ensuring consistency between the local `tsconfig.json` and the Firebase deployment environment's implicit TypeScript version.
*   Thoroughly verifying that all necessary `@types` packages for external libraries are correctly installed in the `package.json` and installed via `npm install` before deploying.
*   Using a `firebase.json` file to explicitly define the runtime environment for the Firebase Cloud Function, helping to avoid version conflicts.
*   If the error persists, try cleaning the project's `node_modules` folder and reinstalling the dependencies.  Also check your Firebase CLI version is up to date.
